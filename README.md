# Godot-Go Multiplayer Project Template

Jumpstart your multiplayer project with this Godot-Go Protobuf-Websocket template. This template is designed to provide a solid foundation for your multiplayer game development, leveraging the power of Godot, Go, Protobuf, and Websockets.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this template, you will need the following installed on your system:

- [Godot v3.5](https://godotengine.org/download) (I'm currently using v3.5 as the web export feature in v4 is not yet on par with v3.5)
- Protoc: Install it using the following command:
```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```
- Make: This is usually pre-installed on Linux/Mac systems. If not, refer to your system's package manager to install it.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Then, you can begin developing your multiplayer game. Happy coding!

### Create a new packet

1. Define packet
```proto
message Test {
    string name = 1;
    int32 age = 2;
    repeated string nicknames = 3;
}
```

2. Generate them for both, server and client (see below)
3. Use the packet
   
`client`
```gdscript
var TestPacket = preload("res://net/packets/test.gd")
var a = TestPacket.Test.new()
	a.set_name("ignoxx")
	a.set_age(42)
	a.add_nicknames("moonsteroid")
	a.add_nicknames("TopG")
	a.add_nicknames("deez")
	var packed_bytes = a.to_bytes()

# send the packet
ws.get_peer(1).put_packet(packet)
```

`server`
```go
_, msg, err := conn.ReadMessage()
// ...
packet := packets.Test{}
if err = proto.Unmarshal(msg, &packet); err != nil {
  return err
}

fmt.Println("Received test packet:")
fmt.Println(packet.Name)
fmt.Println(packet.Age)
fmt.Println(packet.Nicknames)
```

### (Re)Generate protobuf files for client and server
If you updated your packets or created new ones, you will need to generate the packets for the server and client using:

```sh
make generate
```

## Tech Choices

I've chosen Godot, Go, Protobuf, and Websockets for this template due to their efficiency, flexibility, and compatibility with web exports. These technologies provide a robust foundation for developing multiplayer games which works for all exports
(tested only desktop and web)

## Why Protobuf?

Protobuf, or Protocol Buffers, is a method of serializing structured data. It's a flexible, efficient, and automated mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. 

By using Protobuf, we can define our packets once and reuse them in our server and client in a type-safe way. This not only reduces the likelihood of errors but also makes the process more efficient. Protobuf is a superior choice over JSON for this purpose, as it eliminates the need to manually write your bytes in order and prevents human errors.
